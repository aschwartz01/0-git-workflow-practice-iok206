#### [What's the difference between software engineering and computer science degrees?](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/04/10/whats-the-difference-between-software-engineering-and-computer-science-degrees/)

I find this article to be interesting because it not only describes software engineering as described in our lectures, but also what the specific focus is of computer science degrees. Growing up I assumed, and likely many others, that computer science was an all encompassing focus on everything related to computers, including programming. However, this article clearly explains that much of computer science degrees are more interested in higher level concepts, which is why so many computer science degrees have such a heavy emphasis on mathemathics and algorithms. Software engineering, however, is perhaps more industrial in that it focuses on processes and design.
